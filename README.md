# Static Hello World Template

This template illustrates how to create a space with a simple static HTML page. You can optionally include some client-side CSS and JavaScript code.

Once an html file is created in a space, you can designate it as the start file for the workspace by simply right-clicking the file in the Files tree, selecting Properties, and checking *App Start File*.
